# angular-password-validation

This Angular component validates passwords, providing a color-coded strength bar, basic password goals, and optional hints. 

The component combines [ng2-password-strength-bar](https://github.com/rnadler/ng2-password-strength-bar) (with minor modifications) and the [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) password strength algorithm from Dropbox.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.
